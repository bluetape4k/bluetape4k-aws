# Storage and messaging

Spring-facing operations wrap AWS async clients with suspend APIs and framework lifecycle. They do not remove the service's delivery and consistency rules.

## S3 paths

Use `S3Operations` for common object work and presigned URLs. Use `S3TransferOperations` for large or multipart transfers; it activates only when Transfer Manager is present. Treat copy-then-delete moves and presigned URL expiry as explicit application decisions.

## DynamoDB repositories

`AbstractCoroutinesDynamoDbRepository` provides typed enhanced-client access. Resolve table names through `DynamoDbTableNameResolver` so environment naming stays outside entity code. Batch and query operations still need pagination, unprocessed-item, index, and capacity handling.

## SQS listeners

```kotlin
@SqsListener(
    queue = "${orders.queue-url}",
    maxMessages = 10,
    waitTimeSeconds = 20,
    visibilityTimeoutSeconds = 60,
)
suspend fun receive(order: OrderMessage) {
    orderService.process(order)
}
```

Successful completion acknowledges according to the configured policy. On failure, visibility and redelivery rules decide the next attempt. Set processing timeout below visibility or enable an extension/heartbeat strategy.

## SNS and SES

SNS publish helpers and HTTP parsing are separate concerns. Verify SNS signatures before processing callbacks. SES senders expose coroutine and JavaMail-style adapters; do not retry non-idempotent sends blindly.

## Test what can fail

Test serialization, queue lookup, redelivery, duplicate delivery, DLQ behavior, S3 pagination, multipart cancellation, and DynamoDB partial batch success. A successful send-only test is insufficient.
